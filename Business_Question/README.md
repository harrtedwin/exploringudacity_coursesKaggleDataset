### Coding Challenge Guidelines

A daily challenge at the The Room is to determine where to put the
organizational resources - which courses, students, geographies
etc. Download the [course performance
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/udemy-courses) from
Kaggle and follow the instructions given below:

1. Load the dataset into SQL service such as Postgres or MySQL

2. Write SQL queries to address the following business questions:

   (a) Business question: Did the duration range impact the course adoption?

       * SQL: Compute adoption of courses by duration ranges?
       * Instruction: define duration range and provide interpretation of the output (See Task 3)

   (b) Business question: Are the courses well designed at level of difficulty?

       * SQL: Summarize top courses by difficult level? What percentage of student base are covered by each?
       * Instruction: Provide interpretation of the data

   (c) Business question: Are planning courses more profitable than trading courses?

       * SQL: Categorize courses, and compute net profit for each course
       * Instruction: Assume a 1000$/lecture cost and simple like operator

3. Use google spreadsheet to visualize the data from #2 and provide notes in the excel

4. Please create a solution directory and put a README.md with links

### Evaluation Criteria

1. Intepretation of the question and outputs
2. Simplicity and clarity in the SQL
3. Workflow

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch.

Have fun coding! ðŸš€
